		<p> A colleague of mine told me something extremely simple to understand and totally obvious once it was pointed out to me:
			Lets look at how the leaders in our field have solved this problem, a do what they do.</p>
		<p> Its so simple, but so true. Teams of individuals at Google and Microsoft and StackOverflow have come across alot of 
			these problems before and if they have solved the problem in a way that works well, then why should I think 
			that I will be able to spend less time coming up with something even better.</p>
		
		<p> My attempt at keeping up with the industry also includes reading blogs of the greats and following them on twitter. </p>
