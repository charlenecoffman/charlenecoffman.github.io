          <p>As a software developer with INTL FCStone I worked on a team of 4 developers to maintain an ASP.NET C# web application which assisted Financial Representatives in making trade transactions and comparing trends over time.

          <p>I moved to Birmingham to lead a new client engagement, which would be a small team of 2 – 3 developers working at the client’s site on a Content Management solution for a nuclear plant. I completed a full analysis of the solution and designed changes for issues or enhancements requested by the client. As the technical lead for the project, I have managed the project tasks and the expectations of the client and the CTS portfolio director. I have communicated needs for our team when they arose and successfully managed time for my team. In addition to managing the engagement I implemented changes to the many micro-services using PL\SQL, C#, ASP.NET, SSIS and SSRS.</p>

          <p>I worked on the Application Support team and worked on a multitude of engagements as a consultant for the standing software solutions of the clients.
