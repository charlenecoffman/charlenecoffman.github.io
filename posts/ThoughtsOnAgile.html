<h2>My Thoughts On Agile</h2>
<p>First off I think its important to establish that I am just learning this. I am relatively new to software engineering, with only a few years of experience. But I find that the time that I have spent has been first in detailed observation, and second in constant research.</p>

<p>My favorite articles to read on agile usually come from Mike Cohn's blog at <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile">www.mountaingoatsoftware.com</a>.</p>

<p>Most companies who are succeeding in thier respective industries and who are creating development teams for proprietary application & software see the allure of agile. They hear that agile means fast, which means cheaper. These types of companies may attempt to implement agile from books, articles or possibly hiring a manager who has "agile experience".</p>

<p>I think the only way to know that you are hiring the right person, or that your team is heading in the right direction is to do the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Understand that agile is a goal that you work towards, its about the journey...</li>
		<li>Read as much as you can about agile, and hire people who are passionate about it</li>
		<li>HIRE AN AGILE COACH</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p> That last one though...is the most important. Seriously. Hire someone who has not just "worked in agile teams" but someone who knows how to build agile teams from scratch. And remember that it is never too late, if you started your agile journey already you can still hire an agile coach now.</p>
