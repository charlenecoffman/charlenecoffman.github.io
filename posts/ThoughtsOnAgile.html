<h2>My Thoughts On Agile</h2>
<p>First off I think its important to establish that I am just learning this. I am relatively new to software engineering, with only a few years of experience. But I find that the time that I have spent has been first in detailed observation, and second in constant research.</p>

<p>My favorite articles to read on agile usually come from Mike Cohn's blog at <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile">www.mountaingoatsoftware.com</a>.</p>

<p>Most companies who are succeeding in thier respective industries who are creating development teams for proprietary application and software see the allure of agile. They hear that agile means fast, which means cheaper.</p>
