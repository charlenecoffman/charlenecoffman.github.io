	  <h6>Woody Zuill's Mob Programming</h6>

    </div>
	
    <div class="content three_quarter"> 
		  
      <p>Woody Zuill is a leader in software development who writes and speaks about mob programming in the industry. I watched his address at DNC London and began to realize that thier is merit to the idea of not just pair programming, but mob programming. I realized what a high-functioning team's success could look like.</p>
	  
	  <p>He has written books on the subject which you can see <a href="https://leanpub.com/mobprogramming">here</a>. But the recording he did of a mob programming session is a good watch for anyone who wants to attempt to implement this cutting-edge process.</p>
